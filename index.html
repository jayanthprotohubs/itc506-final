            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Click on any cell to toggle the light. The goal is to turn off all the lights. Clicking a cell will also toggle adjacent cells. Good luck!</p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Turn off all the lights on the game board to win.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Clicking a light toggles it and its adjacent lights.</li>
                        <li><strong>Starting Configuration:</strong> The game board starts with random lights on.</li>
                        <li><strong>Winning Condition:</strong> You win when all lights are turned off.</li>
